# Varadhi : RESTBus - A message bus implementation with a REST interface

# Introduction

Varadhi is the open source version of a similar FK internal project, a message bus implementation with a REST interface.
Varadhi supports both P2P (point-to-point) and Publish-Subscribe messaging models. The idea behind RESTBus is to take
your HTTP API stack and automatically transform them into service bus driven, queue/pub-sub, message oriented endpoints.
The communication between Varadhi and endpoints will be on HTTP.

Varadhi is in active development and has been in production since last 10 years inside Flipkart as the backbone of async
REST communication between various microservices sending billions of messages daily.

With Varadhi we hope others would be able to benefit from our learnings of a decade.

See the [Wiki](wiki/) for concepts, use cases, architecture details, API spec and other detailed information.

## Build

./gradlew build

## Run
### Dependencies

To provide the required functionality Varadhi takes a dependencies on various tech stack. 
Current development environment supports below option for these.

#### Message Broker
Varadhi needs a message broker for message persistence and delivery. [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) is used
as underlying message broker. For the development environment users can use containerised Pulsar in a standalone mode. 
Details can be found [here](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.0.x/standalone-docker/).

```docker run -it -p 6650:6650  -p 8080:8080 --mount source=pulsardata,target=/pulsar/data --mount source=pulsarconf,target=/pulsar/conf apachepulsar/pulsar:3.0.0 bin/pulsar standalone```

#### Persistent Store
For storing metadata about various Varadhi entities, a datastore is needed. [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) 
is used as global datastore to persist json formatted entities. For the development environment, containerised Zookeeper can be
used in a standalone mode. Details can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/zookeeper).

```docker run --name some-zookeeper --restart always -d -p  2181:2181  -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888  zookeeper```

To run the Varadhi server 

```./gradlew run --args="src/main/resources/configuration.yml"```
